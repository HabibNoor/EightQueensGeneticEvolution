# EightQueensGeneticEvolution

This Python program uses Genetic Evolution to solve and find all solutions for 8 queens.

solutions.txt contains all the possible configurations for the solutions for this problem. The first number in the text file contains how many generations to get all possible solutions. The arrays after contain the row values for each queen, the queens column position is its place in the array.
So for example, [6, 3, 1, 4, 7, 0, 2, 5]. The queen in the 0th position of the array would be in column 1 of the chess board, and the row position would be 6. Likewise for the rest.
